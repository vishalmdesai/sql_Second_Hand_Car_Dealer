#### Key features include:

🚗 Querying car data by year and fuel type  
📅 Counting total cars for each year  
🔥 Analyzing cars by fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)  
💰 Calculating averages like selling price, mileage, and engine capacity by fuel or owner type  
🔍 Filtering cars based on mileage, price, and other parameters  

##### Step 1: Created Database : cars  
##### Step 2: Created the car_dekho Table with the following columns:
• Name (Car name)  
• year (Year of manufacture)  
•selling_price (Price of the car)  
• km_driven (Distance driven by the car)  
• fuel (Type of fuel used)  
• seller_type (Type of seller)  
• transmission (Transmission type)  
• owner (Number of previous owners)  
• mileage (Fuel efficiency)  
• engine (Engine size in liters)  
• max_power (Maximum power of the engine)  
• torque (Torque generated by the engine)  
• seats (Number of seats in the car)
